This is a vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS calculator created to review front end and basic JavaScript concepts prior to diving into more advanced front end topics like React. This is a single page application that functions as a basic calculator. The display mostly uses flexbox and vanilla CSS. All calculations are performed on the client side in the JavaScript file and are logged as objects stored in an array. Additional logging is performed at various intervals to create a history and for error tracking.
